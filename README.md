Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This data analysis project examines coffee sales patterns across multiple years (2019-2022) for an international coffee distributor operating in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. The interactive Excel dashboard visualizes sales trends across different coffee types, package sizes, customer segments, and geographic markets. By transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, this analysis identifies key market opportunities, customer preferences, and potential areas for strategic growth.
Business Problem
In the highly competitive coffee market, understanding sales patterns and customer preferences is crucial for maintaining market share and driving growth. This analysis addresses several critical business questions:
How do sales trends vary across different coffee types and roasts?
Which markets show the strongest performance, and where might there be untapped potential?
Who are the highest-value customers, and what are their purchasing patterns?
How do seasonal factors impact sales across different product categories?
What is the relationship between package size, loyalty program participation, and sales volume?
By answering these questions, the analysis provides strategic direction for inventory management, marketing initiatives, and customer relationship strategies.
